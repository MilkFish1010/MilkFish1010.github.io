        <h2>Computing History</h2>
        <p>COMPUTERS THROUGH TIME
            Thousands of years ago,
            people made devices like the
             ABACUS to help them calculate
            complex math.</p>

            <p>WHAT IS A
            COMPUTER?
            Although a CD (compact disc) can store
            information like music, it‚Äôs not considered
            a computer because the CD itself can‚Äôt
            change information.
            In the 1600s, computing became
            a profession and the word ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù
            meant ‚Äúa person who makes
            calculations.‚Äù Computers (the people)
            used a tool called the SLIDE RULE
            to help them calculate.
            In 1944, during World War II,
            the first electronic computer
            was made.
            It was called
            COLOSSUS MARK 1
            and was used
            by the British
            government to
            crack secret
            German codes.
            In 1945, Americans created a faster computer called ENIAC
            ENIAC
            Stands for ‚ÄúElectronic Numerical
            Integrator and Computer,‚Äù which
            was the first programmable,
            general-purpose computer.
            Early computers were
            massive-they took up
            entire rooms! These
            computers were used
            by large businesses,
            governments, or
            researchers.
            The first mass-produced personal computer, the APPLE II,
            was introduced in 1977. Owners could use the computer to run
            simple programs or play games.
            Today, computers are tiny and everywhere, including phones.
            Smartphones are considered computers because:
            they run programs (like messaging, photo editing,
            and maps).
            they store information (like photos, contact information,
            and documents).
            they perform calculations
            (with a calculator, with the
            clock/stopwatch, with maps).
            Smartphones are more
            powerful computers than
            the computer used on the
            rocket that took astronauts
            to the moon in 1969.</p>
