        <p>Thousands of years ago, people made devices like the abacus to help them calculate complex math.</p><img class="imgborder" src="https://quatr.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/taxpayingmetz.jpg" height = "300" width="300" style="border: green outset 5px;">

            <h5><strong class="yellowgreen-text">WHAT IS A COMPUTER?</strong></h5>
                
            <p>In the 1600s, computing became a profession and the word “computer” meant “a person who makes calculations.”
               computers (the people) used a tool called the
          <u><b>SLIDE RULE</b></u>
          to help them calculate.</p>
            <p class="description">
            <em>One of the earliest human caluclator, 
            William Oughtred invented The circular slide rule In 1621</em><br><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3489/4021180926_735539d096_n.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;border: green outset 5px;">

              In 1944, during World War II, the first electronic computer was made. 
                It was called COLOSSUS MARK 1 and was used by the British government to crack secret German codes
              
              <p>
                Early computers were massive, they took up entire rooms! These colossal machines,
                 Often referred to as mainframes, were primarily used by large businesses, governments, or researchers.
                  They required extensive cooling systems to prevent overheating and consumed vast amounts of electricity.
                   The operators of these early computers had to be highly trained, as the machines were complex and required meticulous maintenance.</p>

            In 1945, Americans created<br> a faster computer called <br>ENIAC Stands for “Electronic Numerical
            Integrator and Computer,” <br>which
            was the first programmable,
            general-purpose computer.</p>
         <p>   <u>ENIAC</u> WAS MASSIVE, Eniac was massive, occupying a large space and containing vacuum tubes and numerous other components.
           It ran continuously to prevent tube failure. It was far faster than previous electromechanical computers,
            capable of 5,000 additions per second. While the war ended before its completion in 1946, eniac’s first task was to assist with hydrogen bomb calculations. It marked the beginning of the first generation of computers using vacuum tubes.

           first mass-produced personal computer, the APPLE II,
           was introduced in 1977. Owners could use the computer to run
           simple programs or play games.
          </p>
          <p>The Apple II was an innovative personal computer that made computers more available to the general population. Middle-class families could easily afford it and schools also used it. By 1980's end, more than 100,000 Apple IIs were sold, and when the IIGS came out, 3 million had been sold. On the other hand, the Apple II did not achieve the same level of success in different markets, like the UK, where only 120,000 units were purchased in a span of nine years.

            In this day and age of the 21st century, computers can be found everywhere, from powering the internet and the world wide web to connecting people, to even being small enough to carry in your pocket, like smartphones.
            Smartphones are classified as computers due to their capabilities.
            They execute applications (such as messaging, photo editing,
            and maps).
            they save data such as pictures, phone numbers,
            and records.
            they conduct computations
            using a calculator, with the assistance of a calculator
            timepiece, including maps. Smartphones are
            advanced now compared to
            the computer that was utilized on the
            spacecraft that took astronauts to the moon in 1969.<br><br><img class="description" src="https://www.metaltechnews.com/IMG/Aajf0m8qUWqkqfYjVce_8yqdtJ7sh/XPATH/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/1/4/114/s_topXEXT1057x32750is.jpg" height="500" width="500" style="border: green outset 5px;">

                  <p class="description">
                    Connecting computers and other devices to share resources such as data and applications is what networking is about. The internet, being the most extensive network, is essential for conducting business activities. Networking enables communication, cooperation, and information sharing on different platforms. Important elements of networking consist of routers, switches, and protocols such as TCP/IP that guarantee precise and secure transmission of data. In a work environment, a strong network allows employees to work together instantly, enhancing efficiency and productivity.
